# Employee-Churn-Prediction-Model

Knowing the reasons and times when workers are most likely to quit can help with employee retention and potentially even help with pre-planning new hires. 
This is a standard supervised classification problem where the label is a binary variable, 0 (active employee), 1 (former employee), because we have data on former employees. The likelihood that an employee will leave the company is our target variable (Y) in this study.
The HR dataset used in this case study was obtained from IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance and includes 1,470 employees' worth of employee data as well as other relevant employee information. Using this dataset, I hope to identify the primary causes of employee churn and forecast when departing employees will occur.
